\section{Conclusions}

The main contribution of our work is to present a quite complete library for performing
modular arithmetic. Individual arithmetic functions have already been proved correct,
see for example~\cite{BerMagZim02}. To our knowledge, it is the first time verification
has been applied to a complete library.
Our motivation was to be able to certify 
larger prime numbers. Experiments described in Section~\ref{bench}  prove that
this goal has been reached: we are now capable of manipulating numbers with more than 40000 digits.
These tests also show that the library with a native base arithmetic is
reasonably efficient. Expressing the arithmetic in the logic has a prize: no side effect is possible, 
also numbers are allocated progressively not in one block.

A natural continuation of our work would be to prove the correctness a library with side effect.
This would require a much more intensive verification work since in-place computing
are known to be much harder to verify.
Note that directly integrating an existing library inside the prover with no verification
would not be such a good idea.
Arithmetic libraries are known to be difficult to get right. Libraries like~\cite{bignum}
have had a relative small number of users. So their correctness has not
been really experimentally tested.

From the methodological point of view, the most interesting aspect of this work
has been the use of the meta-proving technique to generate our base arithmetic. This has proved
to be a very powerful technique. We have used it in an ad-hoc way: files are generated concatenating
strings. Developing a more adequate support for meta-proving inside the prover seems a
very promising future work. Note that meta-proving could also a solution to get more flexibility
in the proof system. Slightly changing our representation, adding for example to  the {\tt w2} type not only {\tt WO}
but also {\tt W1} and {\tt W-1} would have a devasting effect on our proofs.
Meta-proving could be a solution for prove the correctness for a familly of data-structures rather than
just a single one.

Finally, on December 2005, a new prime Mersenne number has beeen discovered: $2 ^{30402457} - 1$.
It took 5 days to  perform its Lucas-Lehmer test on a super computer. The program
uses a very intriguing algorithm to perform multiplication~\cite{crandall}. Proving the correctness of
such algorithm seems a very challenging task.
