Computing efficiently with numbers can be crucial for some theorem proving applications.
In this paper, we present a library of modular arithmetic that has been developed within
the {\sc Coq} proof assistant. The library proposes the usual operations that have all been
proved correct. The library is purely functional but can also be used on top of some native
modular arithmetic. 
With this library, we have been capable of certifying the primality of numbers with
more than 13000 digits.
