Computing efficiently with numbers can be crucial for some theorem proving applications.
In this paper, we present a library of modular arithmetic that has been developped within
the {\sc Coq} proof assitant.
With this library, we have been capable of certifying the primality of numbers with
more than 20000 digits.
