Recent formal developments such as ~\cite{4color,kepler} have shown all the benefits
one can get from having a formal system where both proving and computing are
possible. In the {\sc Coq} proof assistant~\cite{Coq}, computation is
provided by the logic. {\sc Coq} is based on the Calculus of 
Inductive Construction, so the evaluation mechanism is given for free
by the beta reduction rule. 

A direct application of the primitive status of computation in {\sc Coq} is 
the so-called two-level approach~\cite{boutin}. To illustrate it, 
let us consider the problem of proving the primality of some natural 
numbers.
Suppose that we have defined a predicate {\it prime}: a number is prime 
if it has exactly two divisors, one and itself. 
How do we now prove that 17 is prime? The standard approach is to
directly build a proof object using tactics. Of course, this task can be 
automated writing an ad-hoc tactic. Still, behind the scene, the system 
will have to build a proof object and the larger the number to be proved
prime is, the larger the proof term will be.
The two-level approach proposes an alternative
strategy in two steps. In the first step, one defines a function that expresses
the problem in term of pure computation. It can be seen as a semi-decision procedure.
In our case, it amounts in writing a 
function {\it test} from natural number to boolean such that if the function
returns {\it true} then the number is prime. 
For example, if the natural number
is $n$, the function can check that there is no divisor between 2 and $n-1$
by a simple iteration. 

In the second step, one proves that the function meets 
its specification. This means for our function {\it test} that
$$
\forall n, \textit{test}\,\, n = \texttt{true} \rightarrow \textit{prime}\,\, n
$$
Note that correctness is sufficient for the two-level approach, we don't need
completness. Proving the correctness of our function {\it test} would not make much sense
anyway.
A much better algorithm for proving that a number $n$ is not prime is to provide a factor
$p$ and only check with safe computation that $p$ divides $n$.

Now to give a proof that 17 is prime, it is sufficient to prove that the function
{\it test} applies to 17 returns {\tt true}. As the function {\it test} directly
evaluates inside {\sc Coq}, this last proof is simply the reflexivity of equality.
Using the two-level approach, we have just transfered the problem of building a 
large proof object into a conversion problem: showing that $\textit{test}\,\, 17$ is convertible
to {\tt true}.  The size of the proof object is then independent of the number to be proved
prime. 

Recent progress in the evaluation mechanism~\cite{GreLer} has made the two-level
approach attractive from the point of view of efficiency. Roughly speaking,
the evaluation inside Coq is as fast as the bytecode evaluation of
the {\sc Ocaml} language~\cite{Ocaml}. The only restriction when writing programs
inside {\sc Coq} is that programs must be purely functional, i.e. no side effects are allowed,
and functions must always terminate. This is the price to pay to be able to safely combine proofs
and computations. Obviously, for the two-level to be used effectively, 
the {\sc Coq} system has to provide efficient functional implementations for the
usual datastructures: numbers, strings, vectors, hash tables,\dots 

The contribution of this paper is to propose a purely functional library to compute 
efficiently with large numbers inside {\sc Coq}. The key idea of the library is to 
implement a representation of numbers that accommodates the divide and conquer strategy 
to speed up computation. The paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{ZTree}, we present 
the current arithmetic of {\sc Coq} and explain why a new representation of numbers is needed
in order to compute efficiently with large numbers. In Section~\ref{Op}, we give an overview of our new library
based on this new representation.  
In Section~\ref{word}, we detail two possible instantiations of our library.
Finally, Section~\ref{bench} presents an application of our library to the particular
problem of certifying large prime numbers.
